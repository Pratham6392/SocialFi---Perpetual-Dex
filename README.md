# SocialFi

This platform encompasses key functionalities such as pooling, liquidity provision, staking (farming), and trading. We are building a **decentralized exchange (DEX)** within the EVM ecosystem, powered by an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**.

Beyond trading, this project integrates **social and community-driven features**, enabling users to not only trade but also **connect, share strategies, and grow together** in the Web3 era.
